<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi class! <br> My name is <b>Meen Wook Jung</b> and I am a Community and Regional Planning graduate student. I am on campus this semester and have no experience with HTML, JavaScript, and coding. I took an introductory course on GIS last semester, so I have a basic concept of GIS. I am interested in climate change and urban environment problems. Thus, I look forward to learning about how to use Web Mapping for making a sustainable urban environment. Thank you.
